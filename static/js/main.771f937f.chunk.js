I believe that the only limiting factor is your imagination and it also enables you to create something from nothing with just a few lines of code. Many of the worlds most successful people have started with nothing more than a computer and an understanding of code, no matter what language or framework. Web development is going to be a skill that will be even more in demand over the coming months and years, as the recent COVID '19 pandemic has shown."),o.a.createElement("h3",{className:"question"},"Q: But aren't football and technology worlds apart?"),o.a.createElement("p",{className:"answer"},"A: Sure, maybe upon initial inspection, but if you dig deeper and look at the soft-skills that one has to learn when playing football it becomes very clear that quite a few that are transferrable and applicable in both work environments. Some of the skills that are relevant for both are things like being able to adapt to a constantly changing environment/team, working under immense pressure, good communication skills, being able to give a presentation or talk in front of a team, just to name a few. One of my greatest passions is to do meaningful work. I want to be part of a team that shares my passion of improving the lives of others."),o.a.createElement("h3",{className:"question"},"Q: So what exactly are you skills?"),o.a.createElement("p",{className:"answer"},"A: I have been lucky that football is a sport where there is quite a lot of spare time during the week, which has allowed me to consume courses and build sample projects mainly in React. My main skill-set is primarily focused on the front-end, with a big focus on JavaScript, React and React dependant frameworks such as GatsbyJS and NextJS. Another key area in web development is, of course, version control such as git, which I am very well versed in too. Whilst I absolutely love working on the front-end there is something amazing about creating logical solutions in backend with NodeJS(Express)."),o.a.createElement("h3",{className:"question"},"Q: Do you just sit in front of the computer all day then?"),o.a.createElement("p",{className:"answer"},"A: Whilst I love being in front of a computer creating things, I do have a life outside with many different hobbies. I enjoy photography, going to the gym and running (I am a Carnivore), I enjoy fixing computers and mobile phones too and selling them on as well as public speaking. However, one of my biggest passions is travelling. I love exploring new countries, cultures and ways of living. I am also lucky to be able to speak 3 languages fluently due to my heritage (German, English and Polish).")))};var b=function(){return o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("div",{className:"body"},o.a.createElement(s,null),o.a.createElement(c.c,null,o.a.createElement(c.a,{exact:!0,path:"/",component:h}),o.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"/about",component:u}))))};r.a.render(o.a.createElement(o.a.StrictMode,null,o.a.createElement(i.a,null,o.a.createElement(b,null))),document.getElementById("root"))}},[[15,1,2]]]);
